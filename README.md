# Unbiased-Premium
This github is a code related to Unbiased commercial premium study.  
  
Unbiasedness, which is important to fit the estimation   
당해년도의 preimum expectation is equal to (i.e, the estimation of distribution assumption)  
it is defined
$$E[y_{t+1} | X] = \lambda $$ where $ \lambda \equiv exp(X\cdot \beta) $.

In fact, we usually use the premium(bayes premium) and commercial premium. Then, the bayes has high efficiency but hardly communicate.
However, in the case of the commercial, it is strongly intuitive in other words

# How to use each file  
The code is divided into two main parts.   
The first part demonstrates the inefficiency of commercial premiums, while the second part compares the performance of various premiums, including Bayesian premiums and two types of commercial premiums.   
The performance results can be found in Example 6, within the Numerical Study section (which includes both the Simulation and Real Data Study).
